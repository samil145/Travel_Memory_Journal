</p>

- Let's say user tapped on "**+**" (plus icon). Then, there will be view for **picking image**. User can choose photos from library or take one. And also, user can turn on **flash**, or switch to **front camera** with button on the top.
- If user does not want to add post, he or she can tap on "Cancel" button. Or else, after selecting desired pictures, user should tap on "Done" button for moving on. Afterwards, **add view** will be pushed to the screen.
- P.S. Camera view is not available in simulator, that's is why it is blank. It will work very well on a real iPhone.
